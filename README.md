# Terraform

### âœ… 1. What Is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp to provision, manage, and version cloud infrastructure across multiple providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

### âœ… 2. Terraform Workflow (Basic to Advanced)
Step	Command	Purpose
Initialize	terraform init	Downloads required providers & modules
Plan Changes	terraform plan	Shows what will be created/changed
Apply Changes	terraform apply	Provisions infra as per .tf files
Destroy Resources	terraform destroy	Deletes the infrastructure
Format Code	terraform fmt	Formats Terraform code
Validate Code	terraform validate	Validates .tf syntax

### âœ… 3. Terraform File Types
File	Purpose
main.tf	Main infrastructure configuration
variables.tf	Input variables
outputs.tf	Outputs after deployment
terraform.tfvars	Variable values for environments
backend.tf	(optional) Remote state configuration

### âœ… 4. Providers & Resources
ðŸ”¹ Provider Example (AWS):

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```
ðŸ”¹ Resource Example (EC2):
```

resource "aws_instance" "my_vm" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "web-server"
  }
}
```

### âœ… 5. Variables & Outputs
ðŸ”¹ variables.tf
```
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}
```
ðŸ”¹ terraform.tfvars

```
instance_type = "t3.micro"
```
ðŸ”¹ outputs.tf
```
output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.my_vm.public_ip
}
```
### âœ… 6. Terraform State Management
Concept	Description
Local State	Stored as terraform.tfstate locally
Remote State	Store state in S3, GCS, or Azure Blob
State Locking	Use DynamoDB (AWS) to prevent concurrent apply
Sensitive Data	Donâ€™t commit state files; encrypt state at rest

ðŸ”¹ Remote Backend Example (AWS):
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/vpc.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

### âœ… 7. Terraform Modules (Very Important)
Purpose	Make code reusable, modular, and clean
Example Modules	vpc, eks, alb, rds, s3

ðŸ”¹ Calling a Module
```
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```
ðŸ”¹ Directory Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vpc/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ outputs.tf
```

### âœ… 8. Terraform Lifecycle & Meta-Arguments
Feature	Use Case
depends_on	Control resource creation order
lifecycle	Manage create_before_destroy, prevent_destroy, etc.
count / for_each	Create multiple instances dynamically

ðŸ”¹ Example:
```
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}
```

### âœ… 9. Terraform with CI/CD
Run Terraform commands using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab

Use Terraform Cloud or Atlantis for auto-approval workflows

Example Jenkins pipeline:

```
stage('Terraform Plan') {
  steps {
    sh 'terraform init'
    sh 'terraform plan -out=tfplan'
  }
}
stage('Terraform Apply') {
  steps {
    input "Approve deployment?"
    sh 'terraform apply tfplan'
  }
}
```

### âœ… 10. Terraform Security Best Practices
Best Practice	Details
Donâ€™t hardcode secrets	Use env variables or Vault
Use .gitignore for tfstate	Never commit terraform.tfstate or .tfvars
Use remote state	S3 + DynamoDB for AWS projects
Scan Terraform for issues	Tools: tfsec, Checkov, TFLint
Least privilege IAM for Terraform	Don't give Terraform admin-wide permissions

### âœ… Interview-Specific Terraform Questions
Question	What Theyâ€™re Looking For
How do you manage state files in a team?	
Use remote backend with locking (S3 + DynamoDB)

What is the use of modules?	
Reusability and cleaner infrastructure code

How do you secure secrets in Terraform?	
Vault, env vars, ignore tfstate in Git

How do you integrate Terraform in CI/CD?	
Jenkins pipeline, approval gates

What is the difference between count and for_each?	
count is index-based, for_each is key-based

Have you used data sources?	
Read existing cloud data without managing it

#### Q: What is Terraform and how is it different from other IaC tools?
A: Terraform is a tool that allows us to define infrastructure using code and manage it declaratively. Unlike tools like Ansible or Chef which are imperative, Terraform uses a state file to manage what exists, what changed, and what should be applied.

#### Q: What happens during terraform init and terraform plan?
A: init initializes the directory, downloads provider plugins.
plan checks current state vs desired state and shows what changes will be made, without applying them.

#### Q: How do you structure Terraform projects for different environments?
A: We separate code into modules and use different .tfvars files for dev, stage, and prod. We pass them with -var-file flag.

#### Q: What is a provider in Terraform?
A: A provider is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with cloud services like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

#### Q: How do you pass values to Terraform?
A: Through terraform.tfvars files or command-line flags like -var="key=value".

#### Q: What is a state file and why is it important?
A: The state file is how Terraform tracks real-world infrastructure. It enables change detection and safe updates. Without it, Terraform canâ€™t manage existing resources correctly.

##### Q: Why do you use modules in Terraform?
A: For code reuse, clarity, and to follow DRY principles. It makes infra management easier across multiple environments.

#### Q: How do you secure Terraform projects?
A: Avoid hardcoded secrets, use vaults or environment variables, store state securely in S3, and use tools like tfsec for IaC scanning
